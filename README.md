# hackerwannabe - cyber-security training
Cyber-security training for wannabe hackers. 

## Description 
This is a training course aimed to help you become an entry-level Cyber-Security Analyst. 

## Methodology 
This course is intended to be `do-it-yourself`, based on exercises, self-paced and hardcore `hands-on`. Google, Youtube and ChatGPT are your friends. Like in real-life work scenarios, you'll be given a task and you need to complete it no matter what. 

## Content
You will learn the basics of:
- git version control. 
- PowerShell scripting. 
- SIEM/big-data with Splunk.
- Threat Hunting with Splunk.
- Risk prioritization of vulnerabilities, or Vulnerability Management.
- Infrastructure hardening. 
- Scanning with `nmap`.
- Asset metadata extraction with Shodan.
- Azure cyber-security fundamentals. 
- Cloud integration, orquestration and automation with Azure Logic Apps - or Power Automate. 
- Virtualization with Docker, Vagrant and VirtualBox.
- Pentesting web applications with Kali Linux. 

## Order of execution
It is preferrable you start from the first exercise as you might find knowledge dependencies on advanced exercises. If you are already handy with technologies like git, a quick look at the exercise will give you a hint whether you can skip it or not.

## Exercise delivery
You deliver your excersise by doing a github `Pull Request` on the file `RESULTS.md` where you will add a `h1` header in markdown with your name and below it you'll paste screenshots of whatever the exercise asks you as proof of completion.   

## Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites for this course, other than your time commitment and your appetite to learn new stuff. Questions to the instructors are almost not allowed. In real-life you cannot ask everything to your boss, so you can't do it here. "You need to deliver results", literally as you'll hear at work.
