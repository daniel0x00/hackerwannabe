# hackerwannabe - cyber-security training
Cyber-security training for wannabe hackers. 

## Description 
This is a training course aimed to help you become an entry-level Cyber-Security Analyst. 

## Methodology 
This course is intended to be `do-it-yourself`, based on exercises, self-paced and hardcore `hands-on`. Google, YouTube and ChatGPT are your friends. Like in real-life work scenarios, you'll be given a task, and you need to complete it no matter what. 

## Content
You will learn the basics of:
- git version control. 
- PowerShell scripting. 
- SIEM/big-data with Splunk.
- Threat Hunting with Splunk.
- Risk prioritization of vulnerabilities, or Vulnerability Management.
- Infrastructure hardening. 
- Scanning with `nmap`.
- Asset metadata extraction with Shodan.
- Azure cyber-security fundamentals. 
- Cloud integration, orchestration and automation with Azure Logic Apps - or Power Automate. 
- Virtualization with Docker, Vagrant and VirtualBox.
- Pentesting web applications with Kali Linux. 

## Order of execution
It is preferrable you start from the first exercise as you might find knowledge dependencies on advanced exercises. If you are already handy with technologies like git, a quick look at the exercise will give you a hint whether you can skip it or not.

## Exercise delivery
You deliver your exercise by doing a GitHub `Pull Request` on the file `RESULTS.md`. In it, you will add a `h1` header in Markdown with your name and below it, you'll paste screenshots of whatever the exercise asks you as proof of completion.   

## Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites for this course, other than your time commitment and your appetite to learn new stuff. Questions to the instructor (me) are almost not allowed: the point I'm trying to make it BEFORE you ask anything, I want you to try first by yourself. In real-life you cannot ask everything to your boss, so you can't do it here. "You need to deliver results", literally as you'll hear at work.  

Generally speaking there are some 'general culture' topics/tools/languages that you should know about - and if you don't, just google them. 
- `JSON` & `CSV` data format.
- `Markdown` text format.

## Tips
- EVERYTHING IS ALREADY DONE ON THE INTERNET: ASK GOOGLE/CHATGPT "LIKE A KID". E.g. "How to download powershell with winget", "How to clone a git repository", etc.
